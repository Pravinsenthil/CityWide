I used my expertise in data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning for my project, "City-Wide Traffic Congestion Prediction," to create a reliable model that forecasts traffic congestion throughout an entire city. In order to provide a thorough and precise forecast of traffic conditions, this research focuses on traffic flow prediction utilizing a combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Transpose CNN architectures.  I began by gathering and pre-processing traffic data from a variety of sensors and sources, such as GPS data, historical traffic data, and meteorological data. One crucial phase was data pre-processing, which included batch segmentation into time-series and management of missing information. Because traffic data has temporal dependencies, LSTM was a perfect fit for modeling. LSTM networks are very good at learning.In order to extract spatial information from the traffic data, I put the CNN architecture into practice. When working with traffic data covering an entire city, CNNs excel at identifying spatial hierarchies. The model learns the spatial relationships between the city's various regions and how traffic in one place might impact other areas by utilizing CNN layers.  In order to up-sample the low-dimensional representations that the LSTM and CNN networks learnt and convert them back into a format that can forecast traffic congestion heatmaps, I employed Transpose CNN, also referred to as a deconvolutional layer, for the generative portion of the model. The model was able to produce more accurate high-resolution traffic estimates because to this technique.
